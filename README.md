# Advent of Code 2024
Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions, implemented in Rust! ðŸŽ„âœ¨
This repository contains my solutions for the annual coding challenge, showcasing my approach to the problems.

# Introduction
Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that takes place every December. Each day introduces a new problem, requiring creative thinking, algorithm design, and sometimes, optimization for performance.

This repository is my personal collection of solutions for these challenges, written in Rust. I've aimed to make the solutions:
- Readable
- Efficient
- Thoroughly tested

# Structure

The project follows this directory structure:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day1/        # Solutions for Day 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day2/        # Solutions for Day 2
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/       # Shared utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ input/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day1/        # Input files for Day 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day2/        # Input files for Day 2
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml       # Rust project configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md        # This README file
```
